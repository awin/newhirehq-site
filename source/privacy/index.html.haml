      Website Visitors

      Like most website operators, PayslipBox collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. PayslipBox’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how PayslipBox’s visitors use its website. From time to time, PayslipBox may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

      Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
    %p 
      Certain visitors to PayslipBox choose to interact with PayslipBox in ways that require PayslipBox to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that PayslipBox gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with PayslipBox – by purchasing a subscription plan, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, PayslipBox collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with PayslipBox. PayslipBox does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

PayslipBox visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using PayslipBox’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of PayslipBox’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

      PayslipBox discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PayslipBox'x behalf or to provide services available at PayslipBox, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. PayslipBox will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, PayslipBox discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when PayslipBox believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PayslipBox, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an PayslipBox and have supplied your email address, PayslipBox may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with PayslipBox and our products.

PayslipBox takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
